This is a open (source) web-page project.

In general, i have two similar layouts: One for the startpage and one for other pages.
	You can see the one for the startpage on en/index.html or de/index.html
	The other one is shown at en/template.html or at de/vorlage.html

Evorybody can send/share his/her suggestions for an improvement to:
	Email: frederickk.schredder@web.de
	Discord: https://discord.gg/FsvVKE2k

My mission is building a simple website without adds, wich code is open.


PS: it can be that i don't invest much time for that project, be aware of that.
